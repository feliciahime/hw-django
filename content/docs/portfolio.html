                    <p max-width="500px">Nearly all of my work has been in the health-tech space. 
                      People can be very sensitive about their health information,
                      and using the right tone and voice is critical to building 
                      trust. I enjoy the challenging complexity of maintaining a voice
                      that fosters this trust, empowers the user, inspires confidence in their 
                      ability to take action.</p>

                      guides, and marketing communications, I focus on

                    <p>Diabetes, heart disease, cancer - these are some of
                      the health conditions for which I've created content.
                      I'm a national-board certified health and wellness coach,
                      and I've also written more general content about domains of
                      wellness, such as stress, sleep, nutrition, and activity.</p>

                  <h3>Other Content</h3>
                    <p>I was part of the initial launch of Covered California,
                      the state's health exchange created as a result of the 
                      Affordable Care Act. This work was the first step 
                      into my career in health. I learned the complexity of
                      healthcare and developed my ability to explain it in 
                      simple terms.
