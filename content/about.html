                            <p>Born and raised in California, I've called the Bay Area my home since 2005. 
                                I've spent 8 years working in the health-tech field, learning new things 
                                on my journey. I've been the lone support member who builds an entire team, 
                                written technical documentation and training guides, designed and managed 
                                programs, and been a passionate advocate for improving the user experience 
                                all along the way.</p> 

                            <p>Writing has been my passion since 2003, when I took my first creative writing 
                                course. Since then, I've written short fiction, novels, and poetry. My 
                                background as an English major has made me well skilled in "reading 
                                between the lines" and solving problems creatively. The focus of my undergrad
                                studies was Medieval Literature; I obtained my MA in Scandinavian Literature
                                from UC Berkeley.</p>

                            <p>At work, my strong attention to detail once saved a marketing campaign from
                                immediate disaster (imagine an email campaign to 50k people with the wrong 
                                phone number on it). My writing skills have allowed for faster onboarding, 
                                training, and improved technical documentation for devices and troubleshooting.
                            </p>

                            <p>When I'm not cooking, writing poetry, or playing video games, I'm taking photos of my favorite 
                                feral kitten, Mittens:</p>

                            <p>My favorite games to play on Steam are Skyrim, Oblivion, and Civ V.</p>
                            <p>I've had housemates remember me by the enchiladas I made 8 years ago.</p>
